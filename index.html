        <p>
          Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class
          Aves /ˈeɪviːz/, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the
          laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered
          heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and
          range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9
          ft 2 in) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more
          than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have
          wings whose development varies according to species; the only known
          groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings,
          which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although
          further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds,
          including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The
          digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted
          for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly
          seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.

          Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is
          considered a form of culture. Birds are social, communicating with
          visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours
          as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of
          predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not
          necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a
          time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other species have
          breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many females) or,
          rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce
          offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual
          reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the
          parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after
          hatching.
